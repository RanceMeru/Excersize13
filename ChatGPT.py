Shampoo and Conditioner: Look for a shampoo and conditioner formulated with ingredients that help hydrate and nourish your hair, such as argan oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and jojoba oil. \n\n2. Hair Mask: A nourishing hair mask can help lock in moisture and restore shine, softness, and smoothness to your hair.
